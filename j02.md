## _Mining for Patience_

Recently I put in a order for two crypto currency miners. I will be discussing my experience navigating the checkout process on the site I ordered them from. 
NOTE: I am not a financial advisor there will not be any financial advice posted on here. Initially, I thought that it would be a standard transaction but boy
was I wrong. At first, the checkout process seemed straight-forward like most other online purchases. Below in FIGURE A we can see what the website looks like before 
adding the product to the cart.

As you can see nothing really stands out that is out of the ordinary in the previous picture. Next, I will be showing an image of the shopping cart with the product inside (FIGURE B).

Again, nothing unusual about the transaction... yet. So after clicking on the refund policy checkmark and hitting the check-out button we are taken to the next screen (FIGURE C)
which is your standard contact information page.

Next, we are taken to the shipping page (FIGURE C) which looks like your standard run of the mill shipping page, and that's because it is a regular shipping select page. 
Nothing real unique or different in the process so far.

Finally, when we hit the 'Continue to Payment' button we are taken to what appears to be a regular payment page (FIGURE D), but if you pay close attention to the payment methods you will
notice something slightly unique about this checkout process.

FIGURE D

In the image above (Figure D), we can see that the only forms of payment the seller accepts is either USDT or USDC. Both of which are crypto currencies. The seller does NOT accept
any other forms of payment. Unfortunately, in the world of crypto, oftentimes you'll need to go through multiple steps (and fees) to convert your $USD into the crypto you are trying
to get. This purchase was no different. However, this was my first time ever purchasing something online with cryptocurrency and the margin of error is real thin. One small mistake
like inputting a single number or letter wrong will cause you to lose your currency with no hope of getting it back.

FIGURE E

After selecting either USDT or USDC as your form of payment, and completing your order, you are immediately redirected to a different website. For this example I chose USDT as the form of payment. 
In the above image (FIGURE E) we can see what the third party website looks like after being redirected. Now, this is where things start getting a little dangerous for the
uninitiated. If you look at the image above you will see 'TRC20' and 'ERC20'. What that means is that even though you are paying with USDT, you have to make sure you
buy USDT on either the TRC20 or ERC20 blockchain. I know that probably sounds like a bunch of gibberish but all you really need to know is that blockchains are like digital ledgers and
some coins (like USDT) can be built on multiple different ledgers. The problem here with the payment website is that you can purchase TRC20 USDT and accidently click on the 'ERC20' tab.
By having the wrong blockchain selected you risk losing all your crypto you worked hard to get.

That's just one issue with this payment processing system. Another issue is that you can accidently select USDC as your form of payment thinking that you selected USDT or the inverse of that situation.
Below in figure F we can see what the payment page for USDC looks like. Comparing the USDC (FIGURE F) and USDT (FIGURE E) payment pages, we can see that they are nearly identical in appearance. This
design choice could potentially make a lot of people accidently pay with the wrong token and they would lose all their money.

So after finally figuring out how to get the correct USDT (which required me to visit a different third party site) I was ready to send out my payment. Referencing back
to figure E we can see that I circled in red what appears to be a bunch of nonsense. That combination of integers and letters is the sellers wallet address which the payment
has to be sent to. Had I not done my research at this point, my dream of owning crypto miners would have been shattered. Notice how there's nothing really there to indicate
the wallet address (besides a weird looking icon on the left of the address). In this step it is crucial that the sellers wallet address is exact when sending the payment. 
One wrong character and your money is lost forever in crypto limbo. Something the designers of the page should have put on the site so that people are aware of the risk. To be fair,
there is some wording in red that tells you which coin to pay in, but that could easily be overlooked by a overzealous shopper. I would have designed the site to
pop up a modal with the currency you selected as payment and a disclaimer warning about the potential risks. 

Finally, I sent out the funds only to be denied the transaction. It turns out that if you use USDT on the ERC20 blockchain, you will need to have a certain amount of Ethereum (another crypto currency)
in your wallet to be able to send the payment. This is something I didn't know and I had to go to another third party site to purchase the Ethereum. The total I needed was about
$11 USD worth of Ethereum but on the site to buy it the minimum purchase was $50. Again, had I designed the site, I would have put another disclaimer that mentions how you need Ethereum
in order to send out the USDT in the ERC20 blockchain (since ERC20 is the Ethereum blockchain). 

After many fees and surprises, I was finally able to purchase the crypto miners, but the whole experience made me not want to pay online using crypto. I'm not sure why they decided
to design the payment processing system the way it is. Perhaps they were trying to avoid some sort of merchant fees that are associated with credit and debit cards. Regardless,
The designers could have implemented more safety features to protect its customers from losing their financial assets.
