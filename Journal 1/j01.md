Texas instruments is a very common calculator brand that you will see a lot of people using. I myself use T.I (Texas Instruments). In figure A we can see one of their scientific calculator models.

My goal in this journal is to see if the Casio has a better design than the Texas Instrument. I will be discussing my experience using the Casio fx-115ES PLUS scientific calculator (Figure B). First, if we visually compare these two calculators, we instantly notice that the Casio one has more functionality. At first glance the Casio can look intimidating and that can turn some people away from it. A huge weakness for the Casio. The Casio comes with red and yellow markings on its faceplate above the buttons. This gives its buttons more functionalities. It has a ‘shift’ and ‘alpha’ button which are distinguished by their color-coded names (Figure C).

One is labeled in a red name and the other in yellow. This intuitive design lets us know that if we want to use a feature that is yellow, we would use the ‘shift’ button, and if you want to use a red feature the red labeled ‘Alpha’ button will get us there. This allows the Casio to have more features without adding complexity. The T.I calculator has a similar feature but only one button labeled ‘2nd’ which lets you use the 2nd feature of buttons (figure D).

This technique of adding more feature by giving buttons multiple functionalities is very __learnable__ and __useful__. It is __learnable__ because all you have to do is press the button for alternative functions and you are all set. This straightforward approach makes even the Casio (with its more compact looking design) very easy to learn. The Casio’s design is more __useful__ as it has a lot more functionality when compared to the Texas Instrument. However, for these extra features the Casio does sacrifice some ease of use. By ‘ease of use’ I mean that if you want to use a feature on the Casio there is a lot you have to look at before finding the functionality you want. For example, lets say you wanted to do 'e^2'. In order to do this, you’d have to look around for the desired functionality (refer to figure E) and press the ‘Shift’ button before pressing the desired button (since the functionality we want is colored yellow).

This could lead to time being wasted looking for stuff and frustration among some users. That makes the extra features in the Casio a weakness. Had they gone with less functionality like the Texas Instrument, the Casio would look less convoluted. A simple solution would be for Casio to remove some of the least popular functionalities in their calculator to give it a cleaner looking interface. Overall, I didn’t run into many design issues using the Casio. Besides the design of the interface (which initially can look complex), the Casio is straight forward to use.
